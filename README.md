1. INTRODUCTION
In today’s competitive business landscape, analyzing sales data is crucial for informed decision-making. 
This project focuses on analyzing a comprehensive dataset that includes sales orders, product details, 
pricing, discounts, and revenue information. Using Excel's advanced features like Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, 
and interactive slicers, the aim was to extract meaningful insights into sales trends, product performance, 
and overall business health.
The project addresses key business questions, such as total sales, revenue generation, most ordered products, 
and trends in sales and revenue over time. The results provide a detailed understanding of sales patterns, 
product contributions, and the impact of order types (online vs. offline).
Interactive dashboards were created to visualize these insights, allowing dynamic exploration of the data. 
This report offers valuable insights for sales, marketing, and finance teams to optimize strategies, improve 
sales performance, and make data-driven decisions.
